## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. Adding an image to an HTML element using the CSS properties. 
  For example: 
```CSS
.product {
  background-image: url('../images/image-product-desktop.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
}
```

2. Transforming the contents of an HTML element using the `text-tranform` CSS property. This property helped me change the casing of the text.
For example:
```CSS
h1 {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}
```


### Continued development

Exploring the flexbox and the CSS text properties. I would also like to use more semantic tags.
